## Leaf Classification and Clustering Models

This repository contains various models for classifying and clustering leaves from 36 different plant species. The leaf dataset includes multiple features extracted from the leaves and is stored in CSV format. Additionally, a collection of leaf images is available which can be used to extract additional features and augment the dataset. The goal of this project is to provide optimal classification and clustering models for this dataset.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: Contains features of leaves from 36 different plant species in a CSV file.
- **Images**: A collection of leaf images for additional feature extraction.
- **Objective**: Develop and evaluate different classification and clustering models to identify the best performing ones.
